Then, open the index.html file in your browser to view the webpage.

## File Structure
The repository has the following file structure:
* `index.html`: the main HTML file for the webpage
* `style.scss` : styles of project using SCSS
* `style.css`: the main CSS file for the webpage
* `_variables.scss` : this file contains global variables like colors and fonts
